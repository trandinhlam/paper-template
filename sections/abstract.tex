\textbf{Background:} Social networks have been widely utilized by a variety of popular review
websites, and different users have a different impact on how information propagates
through the network. Identifying influential users in such system could be beneficial
for advertising purposes.
\par
\textbf{Aim:} To estimate the influence propagation probability for social ties in the network
using review data which contains rating and temporal information. Then to identify
influential users in the social network. The new method should be able to tolerate
some basic attacks.
\par
\textbf{Data:} The Yelp dataset was used in this analysis, and we focused on a subset of 5691
users who have at least one of 40077 reviews about 2724 businesses in Pittsburgh.
Synthetic dataset for attacks is generated on top of the Yelp dataset where up to 10000
fake social ties are added in the network.
\par
\textbf{Method:} The convex network inference model was adopted and applied the algorithm
with prior knowledge of the social network. We then used a new method combining
the two modifications on top of this method: the self-exploring model which supports
userâ€™s information discovery without knowledge propagation; the rating model which
incorporated rating data. The credit distribution model for influence maximization
was used for comparison.
\par
\textbf{Result:} Our new model achieved the best outcome in finding a set of influential users
that have a high influence on the network. We also simulated attacks on the social
network which changed 0.55\% to 55\% of the social network. Our results show that the
total weight of the entire network can be changed up to 80\%, but the influence per
review for a set of the 100 most influential users only changes by 18\% with this attack.
If attackers focus on using users with only high number of reviews, this change could
go up to 26.6\%.
\par
\textbf{Conclusion:} The network inference model is adopted and modified to estimate the
influence propagation probability with review data, which is shown to perform well in
identifying influential users in the network while being able to tolerate attacks on the
social network without a severe impact on the result.
