\section{Introduction}
The social network has been largely utilized by a variety of popular review websites. A lot of
such websites supports login via social network sites such as Facebook or Google plus, and by
doing so, it can quickly create a friend list for users to share the content with friends without
suffering from a cold start problem. For example, popular review websites such as Yelp and
Goodreads both support login through other social media account and will automatically link
users’ account with their friends’ using outside social network information. Once the network
is created, users can see their Facebook friends’ reviews on Yelp or Goodreads without going
through the process of manually adding friends after account creation \cite{Baroni1983}.

The core features of these sites and traditional social network sites is the content creation
and sharing among users. Based on positive or negative feedback given from friends, users
might take different actions toward an individual product. Since users have different behavior
pattern where some create content and some solely consume content, different users have a
different impact on how information is propagated through the network.
