\section{Data}
In this paper, we used a data set from Yelp Dataset Challenge. The entire data set contains
a network of 552 thousand users with 3.5 million edges and their 2.2 million reviews for
77 thousand businesses from ten cities. A subset of the dataset is used in our analysis
which contains all 2724 businesses which are located in Pittsburgh. Among the 17124 users
have reviewed at least one of the selected businesses, we then selected the largest connected
components in this subset of the social network containing 5691 users. Rest of the connected
component only contains eight users or less and is thus ignored for rest of the study. The final
data contains 5691 users with 18115 social ties and their 40077 reviews for 2724 Pittsburgh
businesses. For our analysis, we used the following information from the dataset:

\textbf{User file:}
\begin{enumerate}[wide=0pt, labelwidth=40pt]
    \item[\emph{uid}] An unique identifier for each user
    \item[\emph{friends}] A list of uid for current user’s friends in the social network. This friendship
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Review file:}
\begin{enumerate}[wide=0pt, labelwidth=40pt]
    \item[\emph{uid}] The unique identifier of reviewer.
    \item[\emph{sid}] The unique identifier of the business being reviewed.
    \item[\emph{review timestamp}] The date of which the review was made, counting from 1/1/2000 in the
    unit of days.
    \item[\emph{rating}] User’s rating for this business, ranging from 1 star to 5 stars in integers.
\end{enumerate}
